# Algorithm Visualizer Updates

## Summary
Updated all algorithm visualizers to use the same consistent UI design as the Bubble Sort visualizer.

## Changes Made

### QuickSort Visualizer (`src/components/QuickSortVisualizer.jsx`)
- **Complete redesign** to match BubbleSort UI structure
- Added comprehensive controls panel with speed options, custom input, and array size controls
- Implemented step-by-step visualization with proper Quick Sort algorithm steps
- Added code snippets for 5 programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C#)
- Enhanced with progress tracking, statistics panel, and algorithm information
- Uses same CSS classes as BubbleSort for consistent styling

### Binary Search Visualizer (`src/components/BinarySearchVisualizer.jsx`)
- **Complete redesign** to match BubbleSort UI structure
- Added target input field and proper search controls
- Implemented step-by-step binary search visualization
- Added code snippets for 5 programming languages
- Enhanced with search range highlighting and found/not found states
- Displays search statistics (low, high, mid indices, result)
- Uses same CSS classes as BubbleSort for consistent styling

### Algorithm Page Updates (`src/components/AlgorithmsPage.jsx`)
- Marked Quick Sort and Binary Search as `implemented: true`
- Removed "Coming Soon" badges for implemented algorithms
- Made "Try It Now" button functional for navigation

### App Routing (`src/App.jsx`)
- Added routes for `/quick-sort` and `/binary-search`
- Imported and registered new visualizer components

### Removed Files
- `src/components/QuickSortVisualizer.css` (no longer needed)
- `src/components/BinarySearchVisualizer.css` (no longer needed)

## Features Now Available

### Consistent UI Elements Across All Visualizers:
- ✅ Professional header with title and description
- ✅ Comprehensive controls panel with speed selection
- ✅ Custom array input functionality
- ✅ Full playback controls (play, pause, stop, reset, step forward/back)
- ✅ Code viewer with syntax highlighting for 5 languages
- ✅ Progress tracking and statistics
- ✅ Visual legend for understanding colors
- ✅ Algorithm complexity information
- ✅ Responsive design

### Quick Sort Specific:
- ✅ Pivot selection visualization
- ✅ Partitioning steps
- ✅ Recursive subdivision highlighting
- ✅ Swap and comparison tracking

### Binary Search Specific:
- ✅ Target value input
- ✅ Search range highlighting (low to high)
- ✅ Mid-point calculation display
- ✅ Found/not found result states
- ✅ Sorted array requirement handling

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the visualizers:
   - Algorithms page: `http://localhost:5173/algorithms`
   - Quick Sort: `http://localhost:5173/quick-sort`
   - Binary Search: `http://localhost:5173/binary-search`
   - Bubble Sort: `http://localhost:5173/bubble-sort`

3. Test features:
   - Click "Try It Now" buttons on algorithms page
   - Test custom array input
   - Try different speed settings
   - Use step-by-step controls
   - View code in different languages

## Build Status
✅ **All components compile successfully**
✅ **No runtime errors**
✅ **Consistent styling across all visualizers**
✅ **Full functionality maintained**

The project now has a professional, consistent interface across all algorithm visualizers while maintaining the rich feature set of the original Bubble Sort implementation.
